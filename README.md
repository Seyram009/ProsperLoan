# PROSPERLOAN DATASET EXPLORATION

## by JOSEPHINE SEYRAM AGYEMAN


## Dataset

The ProsperLoan Dataset contains various variables like term, recommendations, investors, original loan amount, occcupation, among others on approximately 110,000 loan borrowers.

## Summary of Findings

While exploring the dataset, I noticed some interesting insights. I was focused on the variables that would lead to borrowers receiving huge original loan amounts. The variables Recommendations, Employment Status, Term and Investors were key to the investigaton. I was optimistic that my theory of borrowers with more recommendations will recieve huge loans and those with few recommendations will receive low loan amounts. This was disputed. Borrowers with 0 recommenders recieved about $9,000 while those with 6 recommendations received $5,000. Those with 14 recommendations received a higher original loan amount than those with 16, 18 and 19 recommendations.

Also, with the Employment Status, those who are not employed and borrowers who are retired received higher loan amounts than those working part time; I did not seeing that coming.

However the initial view of borrowers with a longer loan Terms would receive huge loan amounts was confirmed. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

- For presentation, I was interested in the LoanOriginalAmount against MonthlyLoanPayment. I plotted a scatterplot of these variables and had a positive correlation. Most borrowers were paying their loans monthly

- A barplot showed that, on the average, borrowers with 21, 24 and 39 recommendations had huge loan amounts

- Another barplot showed that the employed and self employed borowers payed their loans monthly and they received more loans than those who fall under the other employment statues

- With Term as a variable of interest, borrowers with the highest Term of sixty (60) received huge loans . Most of those borrowers too had the 'completed' loan status.
